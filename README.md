# Defending a Federated Learning system

This repository contains the code that implements a **Federated Learning (FL)** system (using **Flower** and **PyTorch**), two types of common attacks perfomed on a FL system, that are **model poisoning** and **data poisoning attacks**, and two corresponding defense mechanisms: **gradient checking** and **client reputation**.

Additionally, it also contains an implementation of **Homomorphic Encryption**, used to defend the system from **reverse engineering** attacks.

To run the system just execute the following command:
**./run.sh**
