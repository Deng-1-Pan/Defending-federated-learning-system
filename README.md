# Defending a Federated Learning system

This repository contains the code that implements two types of common attacks perfomed on Federated Learning (FL) system, that are **model poisoning** and **data poisoning attacks**, and the corresponding defenses: **gradient checking** and **client reputation**.

Additionally, it also contains an implementation of **Homomorphic Encryption**, used to defend the system from reverse engineering attacks.

To run the system just execute the following command:
**./run.sh**
